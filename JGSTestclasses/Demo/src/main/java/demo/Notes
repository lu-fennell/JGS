-- In Demo1, IOUtils.printSecret(Casts.cast("? ~> LOW", dynField)); works as dynField is not assigned to secret and does not have level H
-- In Demo11, even if dynSecret is not cast, it is assigned by secret, so it indirectly affects result and casting it causes an error.
Hence fails due to NSU(line 17) or cast issue
-- In Demo12, there is no cast at line 17 or 24, hence does not fail
