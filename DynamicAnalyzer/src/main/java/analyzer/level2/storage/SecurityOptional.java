 * This class is a container for Security Values.

 * - Initialized locals should carry some security-value
 * - uninitialized locals should not carry a specific security
 * 	 value, rather they should be marked as "uninitialized"
 * 
 * The name "SecurityOptional" is inspired by the
 * optional of the swift programming language.
